**Planned furture enhancments:** 
1. Get each button to display the color instead of having it set to the .colorDisplay.
2. Use forms to allow the users to input their high scores when achieved. 
3. Add sound when pressing each of the four different colors. 
4. Add an animation for when one user achieves the top high score.
